Welcome to Donut Tycoon! You are a young donut entrepreneur seeking to get your slice of the thriving donut market. Since there are so many donut lovers in your area, the competition among donut shops is fierce. Attract customers with an abounding selection of donuts and rise to the top of the donut charts!

## Instructions
### Donut Shop
Every night, choose how many of each donut to make and how much to sell them for. Your donut advisor will provide some relevant metrics to aid you in your decisions:
- Projected number of customers => Number of customers per day.
- The average customer pays a factor of => Factor of the base donut price the customers are willing to pay, on average.
- Average donuts per customer => Average number of donuts a customer will purchase.
- Passive income => Money you earn every night.

After you have selected your donuts, press "Start Day." Monitor the customer feed as customers enter your shop. The feed will describe what donut the customer wants and how much they are willing to pay for it. If you have the donut in stock and it is within their budget, they will buy! The left hand pane tracks your profits and remaining donuts. Note: the donuts you don't sell will be lost (nobody likes old donuts!).  

The goal of the game is to top the charts in as few days as possible (though you can continue playing after winning).

### Upgrades
These are key purchases integral to expanding your donut shop. There are three things to work towards: ingredients, donuts, and upgrades.  
- Ingredients help unlock donuts. When you have acquired all of a donut's ingredients, you automatically unlock the donut.
- Donuts are what your business revolves around. Each donut has a rarity, which influences how much a customer is willing to pay for it.
- Upgrades improve your business in a variety of ways, whether it is the number of customers or your passive income.

### Strategy
Here are a couple tips to help you succeed in your donut endeavors.
- Pay attention to your donut advisor when selecting your donuts. If you make too many donuts or set the price too high, you may not sell all of them. On the other hand, if you make too few or set the price too low, you won't make as much profit.
- Choose your upgrades wisely. Spending the majority of your cash on an expensive upgrade will slow your progress for the next few days as you won't have as many donuts to sell.
